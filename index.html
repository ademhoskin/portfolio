            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Adem Hoskin and I am an IT Student at George Mason seeking to learn valuable skills in the
                tech field!
                I have some experience coding in Python and R, using Linux terminal, versioning with Git,
                as well as basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS (That's how I
                made
                this website!). This website implements JavaScript to smoothly scroll to a section clicked on the
                navbar.

            <h2>Knowledge and Current Learning:</h2>
            <p>As an IT major, I am knowledgeable in cybersecurity (Security+ certified since March of 2023),
                networking concepts such as the OSI Model and protocols in the model. Along with the skills previously
                mentioned, I am currently trying to learn the following: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
                <li>Database Theory and SQL</li>
                <li>AWS Cloud Architecture</li>
                <li>Bash Scripting</li>
                <li>Frameworks</li>

                    This Python script allows the user to get the audio of a YouTube video, something valuable to me as
                    a
                    music producer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It takes two inputs: the URL of the video and the directory where the audio file needs to be saved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project demonstrates my knowledge of OOP, internal and external library usage, input validation
                    using RegEx, and GUI implementation in Python.

                <h3>College Tuition Analysis Project </h3>
                <p>
                    This data science project done with R Markdown looked to answer the following question using the DOE
                    College Scorecare Dataset:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is there a relationship between tuition revenue made per full-time student and mean faculty salary
                    (per month)?
                </p>
                <p>

                    This Python script creates an Excel worksheet to keep track of truck load invoices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made this script to help simplfy entering truck load ticket data for invoices while working at
                    Adem
                    Inc. (my uncle's trucking company) in 2019.
                </p>
                <p>This project demonstrates my ability to use Python to perform automation in Excel and application of
                    coding in a business enviroment.</p>
